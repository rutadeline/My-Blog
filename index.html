      <h2>Striving academically</h2>

      <p>1. Always Go to class, you might not get in trouble the same way you may did for not attending classes in high school but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go to class because the loss is yours at the end of the day. More importantly, skipping class means missing out on valuable learning. Don’t make your life more difficult by forcing yourself to cram come exam time. Do the readings, taking notes as you do so. You’ll retain much more if you read actively, and your notes will help you out a ton when exam time rolls around.</p>
      <p>2. Be prepared to devote a lot of time to your schoolwork. You should spend the same amount of time on your schoolwork as you would on a full-time job—at least forty hours a week. Bank on spending an average of two hours outside of class for every hour you spend in class, but your library or dorm room is where a lot of the really hard work will take place.</p>
      <p>3. Understand what plagiarism is and how to avoid it. Some people plagiarize because they think they can get away with it; others do so because they honestly don’t know what it means. Either way, you are responsible, and you will get caught. Many schools have very harsh penalties for this behavior, including automatically failing the class and/or including a special note on your transcript. Obvious plagiarism includes copying someone else's work and presenting it as your own. So to avoid this set aside some time to work on your requirements , do your assignments and that way you will be able to finish and turn them in on time without having to stress yourself and others asking for their works to copy last minute.</p>
      <p>4. Learn to use the library. This goes for both the physical location and online databases. Your professors will assign a lot of these, especially at the beginning, but you will also need to learn how to do research on your own. Whenever you get some free time or a free period instead of wasting it wondering around consider going to the library and reading a new book there is a lot of knowledge you don't get diretly from your class you are missing out on.</p>
      <p>5. Keep track of your progress to degree. Colleges and universities will require that you fulfill a certain number of credits in several different areas: general education (minor classes), and classes for your major, and electives. Meet with your advisor or department chair to make sure you are staying on track—otherwise you might find yourself being left behind by your bacthmates or having to take an extra semester that you weren’t planning on to finnish your credits.</p>

      <h2>Managing Your Social Life</h2>
      <h5>by Uwibambe Adeline, Oct 19, 2019</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:90vh; background-image: url(img/Social.jpg); background-size: cover;"></div>
      <p>1. Know the kind of lifestyle you want to live, and stick to it. For some people, college is an opportunity to let loose. For others, academics are the sole priority. Most people are probably somewhere in between. Don’t feel pressured to do anything you don’t want to do just because your peers are doing it, be your own person.
          College is also the time you learn how to be your own adult you have to make choices  and hard decisions and although that may seem hard to do, just as long as they line up with your values and make you happy you are all good.</p>
      <p>2. Learn to live with roommates. Sharing a room is challenging, especially if you have never done so before. It's important that you have a sitdown with your roommates and get to know each other and what you all like or don't like and from there make house rules you can all agree on then agree to respect those decisions once they are made.
        This will help you avoid disagreement and petty arguments and you will live harmoniously. If problems come out, communicate your concerns. It doesn’t help either of you to hold grudges instead of solving them. Whether you can’t stand your roommate or are best friends, it is important that you find a place outside of your room to study like the library.</p> 
      <p>3. Be safe. College offers new freedoms, but it also introduces new risks. Make sure that your behavior does not harm your health. College women have probably heard many tips over the years about how to avoid rape and other forms of sexual assault like sticking to well-lit paths, tell a friend where you are and what time you will be home, etc.</p>
      <p>4. Expose yourself to the diversity of your campus. especially those in international schools, This will probably end up being the time in your life when you have the most opportunity to learn from people with backgrounds radically different from your own. You are really lucky to have access to this, so take advantage of it.</p>

      <h2>Managing your Health</h2>

      <p>1. Learn to eat healthily, even in a dorm room. You’re busy, surrounded by heavy foods, and on a limited budget, all while taking care of yourself for the first time. In this situation, it can be easy to rely on the choices available in the dining hall or cafeteria choices that won’t always make you feel your best.
          Take care of yourself so you have the energy you need to fulfill all of your responsibilities. </p>
      <p>2. Deal with stress through exercise. Regular exercise is one of the best ways to manage the stress that you are dealing with as a college student. You might think that you are too tired or do not have time to fit this in, but it will give you so much more energy. A lot of schools usually have a gym in campus or parks where you can exercise, jog or simply taking a walk. </p>
      <p>3. Take care of your mental health. As a college student, you may find yourself dealing in new ways with depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and many more. Your school will probably offer many resources to help you thrive in spite of these challenges. Don’t hesitate to take advantage of these resources and seek help when you need it.</p>
